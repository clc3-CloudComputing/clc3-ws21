# CLC3 - Cloud Computing

In this repository, the content for part 2 of the course CLC3 - Cloud Computing is maintained.

Part 2: *From Code to a Scalable Application running on Kubernetes*
* **Cloud Abstraction Level:** CaaS
* **Goal:** In this part, we will cover the journey from code to a scalable application running in the Cloud. Therefore, we will learn how to build applications using continuous integration pipelines. After building, a state-of-the-art cloud technology to operate applications, namely Kubernetes, is explained. Finally, ways to deploy applications into a Kubernetes environment are explored by setting up a continuous delivery pipeline.
